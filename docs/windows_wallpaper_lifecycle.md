# Windows managed wallpaper lifecycle

Windows supports two startup routes, selected in **Settings → General → Startup**:
**Open control panel first** (the default), then click **Wallpaper** in the sidebar;
or **Enter wallpaper directly**. Both routes use the same managed
Lively lifecycle. The preference is saved locally and takes effect after fully
quitting and reopening Amadeus; it does not change the current session or restart
the backend. The BAT launcher stays unchanged. Ordinary startup does not prepare
or install Lively or start the wallpaper wake service, so users can begin with
text chat without setting up ASR/TTS. Existing saved startup choices are respected.
Upgrades from the previous direct-wallpaper default also open the control panel
when no startup choice has been saved and no launch override is set. Choose
**Enter wallpaper directly** to retain automatic wallpaper entry.

The wallpaper composer has a borderless gear button, **Open control panel**. It
reveals the Electron main window without stopping wallpaper. The tray provides a
second entry. Closing the control panel while Windows wallpaper is active hides
it again, including when wallpaper was entered manually from the sidebar.

The existing macOS/Linux startup rules and Electron scene policy are unchanged.
Explicit `--wallpaper` / `AMADEUS_WALLPAPER=1` and the Windows opt-out
`--no-wallpaper` / `AMADEUS_WALLPAPER=0` take precedence over the GUI preference.
`AMADEUS_WALLPAPER_HOST=external` retains manual Lively/Wallpaper Engine hosting,
including with **Enter wallpaper directly** selected. Startup mode selects the
presentation; host selection independently disables Amadeus-managed Lively setup
and mounting for external hosts.

## Startup and exit

1. Electron starts its existing Python runtime. Selecting Wallpaper (or the
   direct-wallpaper startup route) starts the wallpaper bridge and managed host.
2. The Windows-only setup checks the existing Lively installation. If missing,
   Windows Package Manager installs the pinned official 2.2.1.0 release and its
   dependencies, with installer autolaunch disabled.
3. A new Lively profile is initialized before its first launch: no setup wizard,
   WebView2 selected, no separate Lively login startup or tray icon. Existing
   profiles are preserved. Windows permission prompts can still appear during
   dependency installation.
4. The Windows helper connects to Lively's named-pipe RPC, waits for readiness,
   saves the previous wallpaper state, writes the Amadeus URL project and mounts
   it. Only then does Electron create its existing interactive Slice.
5. Turning wallpaper off or choosing **Quit Amadeus** from the Amadeus tray
   removes the Amadeus scene and restores the previous scene. Full application
   exit restores the wallpaper before stopping the runtime. Closing the main
   window hides it; the tray's Quit command performs a full exit.

The Windows tray shows preparing, starting and restoring states. Operations
that remain in setup or restoration for more than three seconds also show a
Windows notification (subject to the user's notification/quiet-time settings).
Setup explicitly identifies that first use may download/install Lively. Failed
setup or mounting can be retried in the same Amadeus process after the external
problem is repaired; rejected attempts are not cached. A failed stop is reported
by the desktop host and resolves `false` across IPC rather than rejecting into
renderer event subscriptions.

There is no permanent Windows wallpaper replacement. Lively's optional
screenshot-to-desktop/lockscreen features are suppressed while the Amadeus scene
is active, including the startup restoration of an existing Lively profile.
The underlying Windows picture/slideshow is left intact. The original browser
is selected before recreating the previous Lively scene; its image-update
options are restored afterwards.

In per-monitor mode only the primary display is taken over. Existing span or
duplicate arrangements are preserved. Restoration uses monitor device IDs and
the original Lively project, not a screenshot of its last frame. It does not
attempt to restore a video's exact playback timestamp.

If the user selects another wallpaper or changes layout during the session,
their new selection wins. An already-running Lively is never shut down. A
Lively process started by Amadeus is shut down only after restoration and only
if no new user-selected scene requires it.

## Recovery and ownership

`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Amadeus\wallpaper\session.json` is the durable before-image.
It is written and flushed before desktop mutation. A cross-checkout file lock
prevents concurrent Amadeus sessions from overwriting it. The helper stays alive
when Electron dies; stdin EOF triggers the same restoration as normal exit.
If the helper is also killed, the next managed start recovers the journal before
taking another snapshot. Failed restoration retains the journal and reports an
error. It is never marked successful merely because a command was dispatched.

If Lively must be started with its screenshot-to-wallpaper options temporarily
disabled, `Lively Wallpaper\Amadeus.launch-settings.json` backs up just those
two launch settings until RPC can restore them. This is not a second desktop
snapshot. The `recover` command also handles an interrupted launch preparation.

Manual recovery, after closing Amadeus:

```powershell
build\windows-wallpaper\host\Amadeus.Wallpaper.exe recover
```

`recover` is an operator diagnostic/recovery command, also used by the desktop
experiments; the regular application calls `run`, which performs recovery
inline. Normal exit and a parent-only crash already trigger cleanup. If both
processes are killed, or restoration fails, recovery requires a later managed
start or the diagnostic command. There is no always-running repair service.

Individual RPC deadlines are not an overall exit/setup deadline: several
displays can take longer to restore, and an external installer may stall.
Status/notifications make the wait visible, but this implementation does not
force-kill the installer or recovery process after an arbitrary timer. A global
cancellation/time-budget policy remains a release-acceptance item.

## Build and distribution

Source runs need .NET 8 SDK on the build machine to build the helper once.
The published Windows x64 helper includes .NET 8.0.31, so end users do not need
an SDK. The Electron Windows packaging hook builds and includes the helper and
its dependency notices. It runs no Windows setup for macOS/Linux targets.
Experimental logs, profile backups and screenshots live outside the published
`host` directory and are not included in the application package.

Electron packaging writes to `electron/build`, separate from compiled input
in `electron/dist`; otherwise electron-builder excludes its own output folder
and can omit the compiled main entry. The package explicitly includes the
Windows tray icon under `resources/assets/icons/app`. A missing or invalid icon
does not abort startup, and the main window remains visible if the tray lacks
an icon.

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\setup_windows_wallpaper.ps1 -BuildOnly -Rebuild
# Also prepare/install the host when required:
powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\setup_windows_wallpaper.ps1
```

Lively remains a separate unmodified GPL-3.0 application acquired from the
publisher through winget. The helper talks to a version-specific RPC interface;
unsupported Lively versions fail visibly and are not silently downgraded.
An already-running Microsoft Store installation can be reused. A stopped Store
installation currently needs to be started once; setup detects it and refuses
to install a duplicate. Fully automatic provisioning currently targets the
standalone installer distribution, and requires Windows App Installer/winget.

This change does not turn the source release into a complete packaged Amadeus
runtime installer. Existing Python/model/asset provisioning remains unchanged.

## Windows Slice and input

Windows opens the restored CRT Slice and text composer collapsed. Existing
attention requests can still open their approval surface. The original input
label/dot and authored location remain; expanding reveals a wider, shallow
CRT-styled composer with borderless image, voice and New chat controls.

Image short press attaches a normalized preview (the same image preparation as
Chat); long press toggles watching; right-click selects a window or full screen.
Failed sends preserve the draft and attachment. New chat uses the shared Session
owner and clears the draft only after successful creation.

Windows wallpaper startup defaults to wake-word standby, respecting explicit
process, desktop-setting and `.env` overrides. The gray microphone/standby label
reflects real backend state. Wake detection or microphone activation enters
continuous conversation through the existing wake ASR and auto-send route;
there is no second dictation listener. Short and long microphone presses toggle
that same conversation state. Stopping returns to wake standby; folding the
composer does not stop an active conversation. Wallpaper exit stops its wake
conversation. Other platforms retain the existing hot-window timeout behavior.

`electron/scripts/smoke-wallpaper-composer.cjs` runs the real Slice page in native
Electron against a local bridge fixture, including pointer short/long/right
clicks, attachment encoding/retry, new-chat failure, collapsed startup and legacy
platform behavior. It does not capture microphone audio or make model calls.
The ASR contract tests exercise continuous and timed sessions using synthetic
utterances; hardware microphone quality remains a manual acceptance check.

## Host loss and compatibility

An unexpected native helper exit (including Lively loss reported by the helper)
now invokes the authenticated backend wallpaper-stop endpoint. The backend clears
wallpaper ownership before awaiting cleanup, stops its wake ASR conversation and
wake service, and publishes the usual wallpaper-exited event. Failed installation
or mounting uses the same cleanup. If the owned backend cannot acknowledge the
stop, Electron uses its existing graceful shutdown / owned-process termination
path, so a disconnected host cannot leave that runtime listening indefinitely.

Explicit user shutdown follows the same ownership rule. Both the wallpaper
toggle and switching to Render forward a failed `wallpaper.stop` RPC to the
Windows main process, which uses the existing HTTP cleanup/backend-stop fallback
before completing native restoration. The UI does not report a successful close
when that fallback cannot confirm cleanup. The backend's `wallpaper.exited`
notification still performs surface-only cleanup, without another stop request;
macOS/Linux retain their existing stop path.

The stop request has a five-second local acknowledgement budget. Both Python
HTTP servers use daemon request threads, so shutdown does not join the long-lived
chat/SSE requests; each server uses the default 0.5-second shutdown poll and a
one-second thread join. Wake/microphone cleanup adds its own bounded joins, so
five seconds is an escalation policy rather than a complete worst-case bound.
When this fallback stops the backend, the recovery message explicitly asks the
user to restart Amadeus and explains that WebSocket reconnect alone cannot revive
the process. Original host/setup errors and any cleanup errors remain visible.
Window/dialog failures cannot skip backend cleanup or escape as rejected exit
notifications.

Voice behavior is tracked separately in issue #112; the confirmed default is
standby followed by continuous conversation after waking, not a new idle timeout.
For continuous sessions, `awake_remaining` and `awake_remaining_s` are nullable:
`null` with `continuous: true` means there is no idle deadline. Timed sessions
retain numeric values. External status clients must accept that nullable state.
ASR stop with a source ignores a different owner, including an empty source;
unscoped `asr.stop {}` keeps the original Chat behavior.

Packaging explicitly includes compiled main/preload/renderer files and package
metadata, plus the Windows icon/helper/setup resources. Python/model/asset runtime
provisioning remains external. CI additionally launches the actual unpacked exe
with the checkout explicitly supplying that Python runtime, verifies connected
Chat/Settings/navigation, and closes both frontend and backend. This proves the
packaged executable path rather than a complete standalone installer.

`electron/scripts/smoke-startup-settings.cjs` exercises the actual settings page,
preload and settings store in a separate profile with all network blocked. It
verifies both persisted choices and their launch policy without a running backend.
The composer native smoke also checks the gear button; the real-desktop lifecycle
probe checks that opening/closing the control panel preserves the mounted scene.

## Verification

```powershell
dotnet run --project wallpaper\windows\Amadeus.Wallpaper.Tests
cd electron
npm test
npm run build
```

The Windows Electron CI job also runs the C# contract executable, builds an
unpacked Windows application with electron-builder (including `beforePack`),
and runs `electron/scripts/smoke-windows-wallpaper.cjs` against that package.
This smoke imports the packaged startup policy and tray component, creates a
real Windows tray, checks missing-icon behavior, and runs the packaged helper
in read-only `inspect` mode. It does not install Lively or replace the CI
desktop. Actual Lively mounting remains a separate real-desktop experiment.

Real desktop experiments (temporarily replace the current wallpaper and restore
it in cleanup):

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\probes\windows_wallpaper_lifecycle.py
dotnet run --project wallpaper\windows\Amadeus.Wallpaper.Tests -- --cold-start-probe build\windows-wallpaper
```

The lifecycle probe requires a real renderer connection, then verifies the
original scene/options/running state after normal exit, parent-pipe loss, and
helper termination plus journal recovery. It also kills an actual parent so
both stdin and stdout readers disappear, and checks restoration still completes.
The cold-start probe backs up the
user's settings and layout, starts installed Lively with a fresh configuration,
checks that no first-run UI opens, mounts a test scene, verifies release of the
newly owned host, and restores the original profile in finally.
It is not a substitute for a clean-machine installer test.

For the complete Electron journey, run
`electron/scripts/probe-windows-wallpaper.cjs` using the Electron executable,
with stdout/stderr redirected to persistent files. Do not detach a GUI Electron
process from short-lived terminal pipes: subsequent console writes can raise
`EPIPE`. The probe launches the real backend and verifies the real before-quit
hook; it writes results to `build/windows-wallpaper/electron-experiment.json`.
Add `--host-exit` to terminate only the helper owned by the probe, verify backend
wallpaper shutdown and authenticated/origin-checked cleanup, and then restore the
desktop with the documented recovery command. No microphone is captured by this
probe; active ASR cleanup is covered by the synthetic lifecycle contract.

Validated locally: Windows x64, Lively 2.2.1.0, one active monitor. Multi-monitor
restoration and user changes are covered by contract tests; physical multi-
monitor and a clean-machine install still need release qualification.
