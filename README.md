Amadeus is a **real-time multimodal desktop agent** that brings voice, character presence, and Agent work into one interface. Speak or type naturally, delegate tasks to specialized Providers, and stay involved through visible progress, permission requests, and controls to resume or take over.

The desktop app and Host run locally, with remote services or local inference selected through model configuration. Character packs are optional: Chat and Work remain available without them.

## What Amadeus is trying to solve

Voice assistants, desktop characters, and execution agents usually live in
separate windows: one chats, one performs, and another works in a terminal or
browser. Once a long task starts, it is difficult to see what is happening,
which permission is needed, or whether the work can recover after a failure.

Amadeus connects those experiences into one loop:

1. **Talk — communicate naturally:** speak or type, with interruption across generation, synthesis, and physical playback.
2. **Embody — make the agent present:** voice, subtitles, lip sync, expression, and scene behavior share one playback timeline.
3. **Act — delegate real work:** the main role delegates to registered Work Providers instead of receiving every tool directly.
4. **Control — stay in charge:** Projects, Drafts, Artifacts, progress, permissions, diffs, and results remain visible and recoverable.

The character communicates and narrates, specialized Providers execute, and
the Host owns identity, state, permissions, persistence, and recovery.

| Voice, subtitles, lip sync, and expression follow actual playback. | Background work drives character behavior, scene state, and result narration. |

The video demonstrates real-time voice, character performance, desktop scenes,
Browser / OpenClaw tasks, and a paper-research flow. The desktop UI, Provider
integration, and asset boundaries have continued to evolve, so the video is a
product slice rather than a pixel-exact installation preview.

## Current capabilities

| Area | Current public source |
|---|---|
| **Interruptible real-time conversation** | Shared microphone lifecycle, independent Wake / Conversation ASR, two-stage endpointing, AEC / barge-in, and interruption across LLM, TTS, and physical playback. |
| **Remote Main Chat and local voice** | DeepSeek V4 Flash Main Chat; Qwen3-ASR / SenseVoice; embedded GPT-SoVITS streaming synthesis (v3 by default, optional experimental v2Pro), continuous playback, and mouth values published before matching PCM windows. |
| **Character and desktop presentation** | SpriteForge graph state, a KTX2/PixiJS runtime, subtitle, lip-sync, and emotion timing; Chat, Work, and headless startup remain available without a character pack. |
| **Provider Runtime** | [Pi over native RPC](docs/pi-rpc-provider.md) for daily tasks, Codex App Server / Direct Codex for complex coding, Browser for managed pages, and optional OpenClaw. Claude CLI is a committed future direct Provider. |
| **Durable Work control plane** | Projects, default Drafts, WorkItems / Attempts, Continue / Retry, restart recovery, permissions, the Artifact Registry, and structured diffs. |
| **Artifacts and AUIP** | A Work Artifact can be previewed, opened, or attached as a bounded AUIP AppSession so Amadeus can interact with it without turning narration into execution authority. |
| **Unified settings** | Models, Voice, Providers/MCP, vision, character-pack status, and chat appearance are managed in Electron Settings. |

MCP and Skills remain compatible-Provider capabilities even when they share a
Host registry; **Main Chat cannot invoke MCP tools directly**. Remote DeepSeek
is the Main Chat baseline; remote ASR/TTS remain explicit compatibility routes.
A local voice failure never silently uploads data or creates a second billable request.

`main.py` is not an application entry; it prints a retirement notice. The
Python entry is `uv run --locked --no-sync python -m server.app --port 17777`,
and the desktop entry is `run_electron_utf8.bat` on Windows or
`npm run electron:dev` from `electron/` on macOS. Both discover `.venv`
automatically; choose an installation profile supported on your platform.

## Architecture

[![Current Amadeus architecture: Host authority, Work Providers, Provider-scoped MCP/Skills, AUIP AppSessions, voice, and SpriteForge presentation](./assets/architecture-overview-crt.svg)](./assets/architecture-overview-crt.svg)

The dashed **Memory & Persona Runtime** is a roadmap extension. Its two-way connection to Main Chat represents proposed context retrieval and updates; storage, memory formation, persona updates, and lifecycle mechanisms remain to be designed.

Three separations are deliberate:

- Main Chat, Work Providers, and AUIP applications are distinct authority domains.
- A shared MCP/Skill registry does not expose those capabilities directly to Main Chat.
- Artifacts, identity, permission, and receipts are Host-verified facts; model narration cannot replace them.

Codex currently connects through App Server or Direct transport without the
retired Locus gateway. Claude CLI will join the same boundary later as an
independent direct Provider, not by restoring Locus.

## AUIP application sessions

AUIP is Amadeus's cooperative application protocol. It is not a Provider, MCP,
or Main Chat tool system. It addresses a different problem: once Work has
created a runnable Artifact, how can Amadeus continue collaborating with that
application while preserving Host authority?

```text
verified Work Artifact
  -> Host prepares a short-lived attach ticket
  -> application registers declared state/events/actions
  -> bounded AppSession
  -> character receives scoped projection and action receipts
```

- The ticket binds the current Session, an immutable Artifact reference, and a TTL. The application submits an Artifact id, not an arbitrary path.
- The Host validates workspace ownership, type, digest, and launch entry, and owns AppSession identity, revision, and action authority.
- The application may publish only declared state and semantic events and receive only declared, authorized typed actions.
- AUIP grants no `work.*`, `provider.*`, `tts.*`, arbitrary filesystem, or other-Session authority.
- Disconnects become visible state and invalidate pending actions instead of continuing against stale application state.

The experimental schema is `amadeus.auip/v0`. The protocol implementation,
[Web SDK](sdk/auip-web/), [Managed Core](sdk/auip-core/), application examples,
and integration tests live in this repository. See
[AUIP application sessions](docs/auip_application_sessions.md).
[Code-Amadeus/AUIP](https://github.com/Code-Amadeus/AUIP) documents the current
protocol, public implementation entry points, and future SDK release criteria;
a separately versioned SDK and standalone conformance suite are not yet published.

## Quick start

Dependencies are grouped into four capability tiers. Start with the minimal L1
installation, then add the tiers you need. Torch enters at L3/L4 in the default
ladder; optional RAG also adds local embedding/Torch dependencies. Windows is
the reference platform. macOS with Apple Silicon MPS and Linux source deployment
have also been verified on real hardware; macOS L1/L2 has separate installation CI. L3 offers CPU VAD with **no NVIDIA GPU requirement**. The current L4
cu124 profile targets Windows + NVIDIA. Windows ROCm 7.2.1 has a mutually exclusive
`local-rocm` experimental lock and validation tools for GPUs in AMD's official
support matrix. Apple Silicon MPS uses the verified
`local-mps` profile; NVIDIA cu128 remains an experimental Torch 2.7.0 profile.

All profiles use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and Python 3.12; CI pins uv 0.12.8.

Linux users should start with [Linux](#linux) below.

| Tier | Capability | Platform | Installation |
|---|---|---|---|
| L1 core | Text Chat, Work, Providers, and character rendering | Windows / macOS | `uv sync --locked` |
| L2 voice | Remote TTS, playback, lip-sync, microphone, and remote ASR | Windows / macOS | `uv sync --locked --extra voice` |
| L3 CPU VAD | Real-time interruption while the character is speaking | CPU; no NVIDIA GPU required | `uv sync --locked --extra voice --extra vad --extra torch-cpu` |
| L4 local-cu124 | Local GPT-SoVITS, Qwen3 ASR, and wake word | Windows + NVIDIA GPU | `uv sync --locked --extra voice --extra vad --extra local-cu124` |
| Experimental local-rocm | Local GPT-SoVITS / Qwen3 ASR sidecars | Windows + GPU in AMD's official support matrix | `uv sync --locked --extra voice --extra vad --extra local-rocm` |

The four default tiers and the ROCm experiment use **the same `.venv`**. Give the
complete target configuration each time: `uv sync` is exact and removes packages
from omitted tiers. `torch-cpu`, `local-cu124`, `local-cu128`, `local-mps`, and `local-rocm` are pairwise
incompatible. To switch builds, replace the build extra while keeping `voice`
and `vad`. See [installation profiles and migration](docs/install_profiles.md).

- Main Chat defaults to remote DeepSeek. llama.cpp is an optional local LLM
  profile under [Compatibility routes](#compatibility-routes), not an installation prerequisite.
- L2 without VAD uses energy-based endpoint detection. Adding VAD enables
  Silero endpointing and interruption.
- On Windows, check each tier with
  `uv run --locked --no-sync python tools/verify_python_environment.py --profile <cpu|voice|vad-cpu>`
  (`ci` shares the core import checks). For L4, use `--profile cu124 --require-cuda-device`.
  For ROCm, use `--profile rocm`, then run the GPU compute probe. Import/build
  checks do not replace real model and audio-device tests.
- L1 is sufficient for text-only/headless use. Start the backend with
  `uv run --locked --no-sync python -m server.app --port 17777`.
  Set `TTS_BACKEND=disabled` and disable Wake for a strict text-only profile.

### Reference hardware

**L1/L2 (Windows / macOS)**

- CPython **3.12**, managed by uv; no system Python installation required
- Node.js **22** (`22.21.1` is the current reference)
- No GPU required

**Additional requirements for L4 cu124 (Windows local models)**

- CUDA 12.4-compatible NVIDIA GPU, targeting **8 GiB VRAM**
- **16 GiB system RAM minimum; 32 GiB recommended**

Peak memory depends on local ASR/TTS models and concurrency. The target describes
the remote-Chat/local-voice profile. An optional local LLM needs additional
memory according to its model, quantization, context, and GPU offload.

### Base environment (L1/L2, Windows / macOS)

Install uv with `winget install astral-sh.uv` on Windows or `brew install uv` on
macOS. For L2 on macOS, install PortAudio first with `brew install portaudio`;
PyAudio builds from source there. Then clone and choose a tier with the same
commands on both platforms:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Code-Amadeus/Amadeus.git
cd Amadeus

uv venv .venv --python 3.12
uv sync --locked                              # L1 core
uv sync --locked --extra voice                # L2 voice (optional)
```

Keep the environment named `.venv`. Electron discovers its interpreter
automatically (`Scripts/python.exe` on Windows, `bin/python3` on macOS), without
requiring an `AMADEUS_PYTHON` override.

Build the Electron frontend on either platform:

```bash
cd electron
npm ci
npm run build
cd ..
```

`npm ci` uses the project postinstall hook to install Electron and the pinned
Pi runtime for the default daily-task agent. No separate Pi installation is
needed for desktop use. The default Pi connection reuses the same
`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` configured for Main Chat under Settings -> Models or in
`.env`; it does not require another agent installation or login. After restart,
the backend checks the pinned runtime and selected model credentials before Pi
is advertised as available. See [Pi configuration](docs/pi-rpc-provider.md) for
headless installation, native authentication, and custom model endpoints.
Where network access requires it, configure npm/Electron mirrors, such as
`ELECTRON_MIRROR=https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/electron/`.

### Linux

**Linux source deployment has been verified on real hardware.** [Phase 1 Linux CI (#63)](https://github.com/Code-Amadeus/Amadeus/pull/63)
has passed locked L1 + dev installation, environment imports and model-less
dependency checks, basic contract tests, Ruff, architecture-view checks, and the
Electron build on Ubuntu 24.04. A separate Voice source-build job checks locked
installation, AEC import, bundled Abseil selection and related contracts. CI does
not cover the Electron GUI, real audio devices, VAD/local model inference,
Wayland sessions, or wallpaper integration.
Additional jobs check cu128 candidate installation, dependencies and transitions
back to CPU VAD; they do not qualify real GPU model inference.

The community has reported desktop and character-rendering results on Arch Linux /
Wayland. These reports do not establish compatibility across all distributions or
desktop environments. See [Linux tracking issue #64](https://github.com/Code-Amadeus/Amadeus/issues/64)
for environment records, known issues, and follow-up work.

Install Git, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (`0.12.8` in CI), and Node.js 22
(`22.21.1` in CI), then start with L1, which needs no GPU or voice packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Code-Amadeus/Amadeus.git
cd Amadeus
uv venv .venv --python 3.12.10
uv sync --locked
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`, provide `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, set `TTS_BACKEND=disabled`, and keep
`WAKE_ENABLED=false` to try the text-only path first. Verify the environment from
the project root:

```bash
uv run --locked --no-sync python tools/verify_python_environment.py --profile cpu
```

Build and launch Electron from a Linux graphical desktop session. The launcher
automatically discovers `.venv/bin/python3` and starts the backend:

```bash
cd electron
npm ci
npm run build
npm run electron:dev
```

The desktop `npm ci` also installs Pi. The default Pi connection reuses the
DeepSeek credential from the base configuration and is checked when the backend
starts; custom model authentication is described in [Pi configuration](docs/pi-rpc-provider.md).

For a headless backend instead, run this from the project root:

```bash
uv run --locked --no-sync python -m server.app --port 17777
```

For remote voice, recording and playback, install L2 in the same `.venv`.
On Ubuntu 24.04, install the native prerequisites used by CI first; other Linux
distributions need their corresponding package names:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y build-essential pkg-config portaudio19-dev
uv sync --locked --extra voice
uv run --locked --no-sync python tools/verify_python_environment.py --profile voice
```

For voice, local models, and desktop integration, see the component-specific notes:

- **Voice / AEC:** Linux uses vendored source based on the official
  `aec-audio-processing==1.0.1` sdist and forces bundled Abseil 20240722.0 to avoid
  selecting an incompatible modern system Abseil. The system installation is
  unchanged; Windows/macOS retain their registry artifacts. Source identity,
  the isolated patch and removal conditions are in [AEC provenance](vendor/aec-audio-processing.PROVENANCE.md).
  Build/import success does not qualify real-device echo cancellation or full voice interaction.
- **VAD / NVIDIA:** Linux CPU VAD and the `local-cu128` candidate have explicit
  Torch build selections and installation/contract CI. The cu124 reference
  remains Windows-specific; real GPU inference and full voice interaction
  require device acceptance. See the candidate profiles below.
- **Desktop / wallpaper:** GUI and Wayland compositor integration need separate
  acceptance. Community GNOME results do not establish support for niri, KDE, or
  other desktops.

### VAD and local models

Use the same `.venv` as L1/L2 and select the complete capability/build combination.

**L3 CPU VAD — real-time interruption:** Torch enters as a CPU build.

```powershell
uv sync --locked --extra voice --extra vad --extra torch-cpu
uv run --locked --no-sync python tools\verify_python_environment.py --profile vad-cpu
```

**L4 local-cu124 — local voice models:** select the CUDA profile in that same
environment. On Windows, `[tool.uv.sources]` routes this extra's Torch/Torchaudio
packages to the PyTorch cu124 index.

```powershell
uv sync --locked --extra voice --extra vad --extra local-cu124
uv run --locked --no-sync python tools\verify_python_environment.py --profile cu124 --require-cuda-device
```

The L4 profile pins `torch==2.6.0+cu124`, `torchaudio==2.6.0+cu124`, and the local
model dependencies. This is the current qualified local-model profile.

**Experimental local-rocm (Windows):** this profile targets GPUs in AMD's official
ROCm 7.2.1 Windows PyTorch support matrix. The same `.venv` can select ROCm 7.2.1,
Torch/Torchaudio 2.9.1, and the local-model dependencies. Persistent Qwen ASR and
GPT-SoVITS sidecars use that environment's interpreter by default. This profile
conflicts with cu124/CPU Torch builds. After installation, run the environment
check and GPU compute validation before loading models. See the
[Windows ROCm sidecar guide](tools/rocm_sidecar/README.md) for supported hardware,
installation commands, and validation steps.

**Torch 2.7 profiles:** `local-cu128` (Windows/Linux x86_64)
and `local-mps` (Apple Silicon) select locked Torch/Torchaudio 2.7.0 packages.
Apple Silicon MPS has been verified on real hardware; cu128 remains an experimental
NVIDIA profile. Windows cu124 remains the reference, and Windows ROCm retains
AMD's 2.9.1 pair.

```bash
# Windows/Linux NVIDIA candidate, including the model dependency set
uv sync --locked --extra voice --extra vad --extra local-cu128
uv run --locked --no-sync python tools/verify_python_environment.py --profile cu128

# Apple Silicon MPS
uv sync --locked --extra voice --extra vad --extra local-mps
uv run --locked --no-sync python tools/verify_python_environment.py --profile mps
```

Select only the command for your platform. Installation and CPU contract CI do
not qualify GPU inference, microphones, continuous playback or interruption.
Issue #67 reports standalone Qwen-ASR MPS results on an M4 Max; the application
currently accepts only CPU/CUDA Qwen device selection. Installing `local-mps`
does not enable application ASR MPS routing. GPT-SoVITS supports the MPS path
through the `local-mps` environment.

RTX 50-series users should evaluate cu128; cu124 is not a Blackwell baseline.
FlashAttention remains optional. Matching cp312/Torch 2.7/cu128 community Windows
and upstream Linux wheels have been located; see
[Torch 2.7 and FlashAttention candidates](docs/torch27_candidates.md) for sources,
hashes and verification limits.

### Install external runtime assets

[Optional character RAG](docs/character_rag.md) is off by default and works with
remote and local Main Chat. It includes a buildable Chinese/Japanese starter
corpus and supports personal knowledge directories. Settings shows applied
thresholds and loading state. RAG adds local embedding/Torch dependencies;
the guide covers setup, diagnostics and evaluation limits.

The default local-voice profile uses the Qwen ASR and GPT-SoVITS v3 voice packs.
The visual and character packs are optional:

```powershell
uv run --locked --no-sync python tools\external_assets.py verify C:\Downloads\amadeus-asr-qwen3-0.6b.zip
uv run --locked --no-sync python tools\external_assets.py install C:\Downloads\amadeus-asr-qwen3-0.6b.zip
uv run --locked --no-sync python tools\external_assets.py verify C:\Downloads\amadeus-voice-kurisu-gpt-sovits-v3.zip
uv run --locked --no-sync python tools\external_assets.py install C:\Downloads\amadeus-voice-kurisu-gpt-sovits-v3.zip

# Optional scene and KTX2 character animation
uv run --locked --no-sync python tools\external_assets.py install C:\Downloads\amadeus-visual-runtime.zip
uv run --locked --no-sync python tools\external_assets.py install C:\Downloads\amadeus-character-kurisu.zip
uv run --locked --no-sync python tools\external_assets.py status
```

To try **Kurisu v2Pro**, install the separately supplied experimental add-on
after the v3 voice pack. It contains the v2Pro GPT/SoVITS checkpoint pair and
ERes2Net speaker encoder, and reuses the BERT, CNHuBERT, and reference audio
already installed by the v3 pack:

```powershell
uv run --locked --no-sync python tools\external_assets.py verify C:\Downloads\amadeus-voice-kurisu-gpt-sovits-v2pro-experimental.zip
uv run --locked --no-sync python tools\external_assets.py install C:\Downloads\amadeus-voice-kurisu-gpt-sovits-v2pro-experimental.zip
```

In **Settings → Voice → Voice backends → Embedded GPT-SoVITS model**, select
**Kurisu v2Pro · experimental** under **Voice checkpoint profile**, then restart
the backend. For `.env` configuration, set `TTS_VOICE_PROFILE=kurisu_v2pro`;
`kurisu_v3` remains the default in `.env.example`. Named profiles select both
checkpoints together. The embedded runtime supports v1, v2, v2Pro, v2ProPlus,
and v3 checkpoints; use `custom` with `TTS_GPT_MODEL_PATH` and
`TTS_SOVITS_MODEL_PATH` for another compatible pair. v2Pro/v2ProPlus also require
the speaker-encoder weight supplied in the add-on. Selecting v2Pro does not
enable the optional `TTS_T2S_FLASH_ATTN` path; it remains off by default.

**v2ProPlus is also supported by the same inference pipeline**, including
speaker conditioning, session caching, CUDA Graph, and streaming playback.
To use it, select **Custom checkpoint pair** (`TTS_VOICE_PROFILE=custom`) and
set the GPT and SoVITS paths to a compatible v2ProPlus pair, then restart the
backend. It uses the same ERes2Net speaker encoder as v2Pro. There is currently
no named Kurisu v2ProPlus profile or separate Plus asset pack; the experimental
Kurisu pack above contains v2Pro weights. The real-inference validation for this
change used v2Pro; v2ProPlus was not separately exercised with real weights.

If a prepared Qwen pack is unavailable, download the upstream snapshot into
the same canonical location. Runtime inference remains offline and will not
start an implicit download when the microphone is opened:

```powershell
uv run --locked --no-sync python -c "from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download; snapshot_download('Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-0.6B', local_dir='assets/models/asr/qwen3-asr-0.6b')"
```

The Japanese GPT-SoVITS frontend prepares an OpenJTalk dictionary on first
use. Prewarm it once if the normal application launch must remain offline:

```powershell
uv run --locked --no-sync python -c "import pyopenjtalk; print(pyopenjtalk.g2p('準備完了'))"
```

### Configure and launch

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (`Copy-Item .env.example .env` on Windows;
`cp .env.example .env` on macOS), provide the DeepSeek API key, then review Settings:

- **Models:** `deepseek`, the official endpoint, `deepseek-v4-flash`, and an API key;
- **Voice:** Fish Audio S2.1 + Kurisu is the recommended remote TTS profile; MiMo and OpenAI-compatible endpoints are also supported. The L4 local stack also needs a Qwen model directory, a compatible GPT-SoVITS checkpoint pair (**Kurisu v3** by default or experimental **Kurisu v2Pro**), reference audio/text, microphone, AEC, and barge-in;
- **General:** optional character-pack status and presentation settings.

Launch Amadeus:

- Windows: `run_electron_utf8.bat`, the shared launcher for L1–L4; it discovers `.venv` automatically.
- macOS: `cd electron && npm run electron:dev`.

For wallpaper startup at macOS login, use the native `Amadeus Wallpaper.app`.
Build, verification, and LaunchAgent installation steps are documented in
[macOS wallpaper startup](docs/macos_wallpaper_startup.md).

Use **Restart backend to apply** after changing startup settings. A
**Not installed** character pack is healthy and does not disable Chat, Work,
or headless startup.

The default B2 AppSession action path does not block first-time setup. Chat and
Settings still start without supported AUIP action-model credentials; application
actions remain blocked, and Settings displays the missing capability.

### VN Player setup (Windows, experimental)

VN Player needs a separately installed text extractor and a compatible game.
Choose either **0xDC00 Agent** or **LunaTranslator** and follow its setup below.

#### 0xDC00 Agent

For this route, **the hook script is the game's extraction `.js` file**;
**Full script for alignment** is a separate, optional story-text file and can be
left empty. Amadeus does not install Agent, game scripts, or games for you.

1. Download the Windows build from [0xDC00 Agent releases](https://github.com/0xDC00/agent/releases)
   and extract the whole archive. Keep `agent.exe` and its `data` folder together.
2. In Agent's script selector, use **update scripts** to obtain the
   [official script collection](https://github.com/0xDC00/scripts). Choose the
   script matching your game's platform and version; keep its shared libraries in
   `data/scripts`. The [installation guide](docs/vn-text-sources.md#0xdc00-agent)
   also explains manual installation and how to check the script first.
3. Enable Agent's **WebSocket** output at `127.0.0.1:9001`, the desktop profile's
   expected endpoint. Close any manually opened Agent before starting it through
   Amadeus. Clipboard output is not used.
4. Open **VN Player → Add game**. Choose a game type, select **0xDC00 Agent**, then
   browse to the game's actual `.exe`, its hook `.js`, and `agent.exe`. Choose
   **Steam** if the game needs Steam startup, or **I will start the game** for
   another launcher. Leave the full story script empty to begin with live text.
5. Click **Save and test text**, advance several dialogue lines, and compare the
   preview with the game. This test requires no model call. Once it looks right,
   use **Text looks right — start companion**. Configure the connection used by
   **VN companion** in Settings for model replies; subsequent sessions use **Start**.

#### LunaTranslator

Use the full LunaTranslator application for this route. **Agent and its `.js`
scripts are not required**; standalone LunaHook does not provide this integration's
original-text network service by itself.

1. Follow [LunaTranslator's official download guide](https://docs.lunatranslator.org/en/README.html),
   extract the complete package, and run `LunaTranslator.exe`.
2. Start the game. In Luna's **HOOK mode**, select its process, advance dialogue,
   and choose the text stream matching the game in the text-selection window.
   Confirm original text continues to arrive; see the [official HOOK tutorial](https://docs.lunatranslator.org/en/basicuse.html).
3. Enable [Luna's network service](https://docs.lunatranslator.org/en/apiservice.html)
   and note its configured port. Keep Luna and the service running while playing.
4. In **VN Player → Add game**, select **Luna original text (experimental)**. Set
   **Luna WebSocket URL** to `ws://127.0.0.1:<port>/api/ws/text/origin`, replacing
   `<port>` with the service's actual port. Use the original-text endpoint, not
   `/api/ws/text/trans` or a web-page address.
5. Choose **I will start the game** to manage startup externally; the game executable
   can then be empty. Supply the actual game `.exe` for automatic exe/Steam startup
   or game-window vision. **Full script for alignment** remains optional.
6. Use **Save and test text**, advance dialogue, and compare the preview before
   selecting **Text looks right — start companion**. Capture testing makes no model
   calls; replies require the connection used by **VN companion** in Settings.

Amadeus does not launch Luna or select its hooks. **End session** disconnects the
stream without closing Luna. See the [Luna integration details](docs/vn-text-sources.md#lunatranslator).

For either source's missing text, script dependencies, and connection failures, see
[troubleshooting](docs/vn-text-sources.md#setup-troubleshooting).

## Compatibility routes

### Optional local LLM

To use llama.cpp instead of the remote Main Chat baseline, set
`LLM_PROVIDER=local`, configure its executable/GGUF or an existing
OpenAI-compatible endpoint, and start it when needed:

```powershell
.\start_llm_server.bat
```

LM Studio, Ollama, llama-cli, and hybrid profiles remain available, but none is
an automatic fallback after a DeepSeek failure.

### Optional remote model recommendations

These are recommended profiles for the current APIs. They do not change the
role split above, and Amadeus never switches Providers silently after an endpoint
failure:

| Responsibility | Recommended profile | Current boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Main Chat API | DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731: `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com` and `DEEPSEEK_MODEL_NAME=deepseek-v4-flash` | `deepseek-v4-flash` is the stable API alias currently pointing to the 0731 release; the dated version is not used as the runtime model id. |
| Remote speech synthesis | **Fish Audio S2.1**: `TTS_BACKEND=fish_audio`, `FISH_TTS_MODEL=s2.1-pro-free`; Kurisu voice: `FISH_TTS_REFERENCE_ID=b450b19370434173b121446057622e9b` | Bidirectional WebSocket streaming; locally committed sentence chunks use `text → flush`, with incremental audio output. Existing Chat sentence scheduling is preserved. |
| Multimodal / Vision | Prefer `gemini-3.7-flash`; use `gemini-3.5-flash` as a more conservative compatibility profile | Host-owned visual context performs capture in-process, while image delivery still follows the Main Chat Provider. Independent Gemini Vision API routing is not implemented and does not imply restoring the retired Gemini Live sidecar. |
| Work execution Provider | Pi for daily tasks; Codex App Server for complex coding | Desktop installation includes the pinned Pi runtime; [configure model credentials](docs/pi-rpc-provider.md). OpenClaw remains optional for explicit selection; Browser retains managed-page operations. |
| Work execution model | Codex App Server may explicitly select a GPT-5.6-family model or `deepseek-v4-flash` | The execution model belongs to the Work Provider and does not share Main Chat routing or credentials. |
| AUIP runtime action decisions | `AUIP_ACTION_PROVIDER=openai`, `AUIP_ACTION_MODEL=gpt-5.6-terra`, `AUIP_ACTION_REASONING_EFFORT=low`, and `AUIP_ACTION_SERVICE_TIER=fast` | This model decides AppSession actions and participation; it is not the execution Provider that authors an AUIP Artifact. `fast` requires availability for the API project. |

### Recommended remote TTS: Fish Audio + Kurisu

After installing L2 voice, select **Fish Audio** under **Settings → Voice →
Speech synthesis**, enter the API key, and restart the backend. Use:

| Setting | Recommended value |
|---|---|
| Fish inference model ID (S2.1 free model) | `s2.1-pro-free` |
| Kurisu voice / reference ID | `b450b19370434173b121446057622e9b` |
| Voice page | [Makise kurisu / 牧濑红莉栖](https://fish.audio/zh-CN/app/text-to-speech/?modelId=b450b19370434173b121446057622e9b) |
| WebSocket endpoint | `wss://api.fish.audio/v1/tts/live` |
| Latency mode | `balanced` |

The equivalent local `.env` configuration is:

```dotenv
TTS_BACKEND=fish_audio
FISH_TTS_API_KEY=<your-fish-api-key>
FISH_TTS_MODEL=s2.1-pro-free
FISH_TTS_REFERENCE_ID=b450b19370434173b121446057622e9b
FISH_TTS_LATENCY=balanced
```

The Japanese voice ID is separate from the inference model ID. GUI credentials
use the existing encrypted store. This remote recommendation does not change the
default embedded GPT-SoVITS backend. A three-trial Windows baseline with DeepSeek
measured a **3.70 s** median from `chat.send` to the first non-silent device write,
plus roughly 91 ms reported output latency; other networks and cold starts vary.
See [Fish Audio setup, chunk probes, and audio checks](docs/fish_audio_websocket.md).

## External models and runtime assets

Model weights, reference audio, character packs, and large or copyright-
sensitive media are distributed separately. The source repository keeps the
required icons, default wallpaper, schemas, validators, and installation tool.

Visit the [Code Amadeus resource hub](https://code-amadeus.github.io/#resources)
for available resource links and download information.

The local-voice directory contracts are `asr-qwen3-0.6b` and
`voice-kurisu-gpt-sovits-v3`, with the optional
`voice-kurisu-gpt-sovits-v2pro-experimental` add-on for v2Pro. The v3 pack provides
shared resources required by the add-on. `visual-runtime` and `character-kurisu`
affect scene and character presentation. See the [asset bundle guide](docs/external_asset_bundles.md)
for pack contents and installation details.

```powershell
uv run --locked --no-sync python tools\external_assets.py verify C:\path\to\asset-bundle.zip
uv run --locked --no-sync python tools\external_assets.py install C:\path\to\asset-bundle.zip
uv run --locked --no-sync python tools\external_assets.py status
```

A bundle can be installed from any tier: `external_assets.py` uses only the
Python standard library. Running local voice models additionally requires the
matching model dependencies and hardware; installing a bundle alone does not
add them. See [installation profiles](docs/install_profiles.md) for the qualified
cu124 profile and the ROCm experimental boundary.

A SpriteForge character package ultimately lands at:

```text
assets/spriteforge/runtime/kurisu/
  runtime_manifest.json
  graph_config.json
  spriteforge_mouth_config.json
  textures/
```

The installer preserves the canonical `assets/...` layout, verifies SHA-256,
skips identical files, and rejects unexpected overwrites. See
[external asset bundles](docs/external_asset_bundles.md) and the
[character-pack contract](docs/character_pack_authoring.md).

### Wallpaper mode (Lively Wallpaper recommended)

On Windows, the open-source
[Lively Wallpaper](https://github.com/rocksdanister/lively) is the recommended
host for Amadeus's web wallpaper. Windows now starts in managed wallpaper mode:
it prepares Lively 2.2.1.0, mounts the scene, and restores the previous wallpaper
when **Quit Amadeus** is selected in the Amadeus tray menu. `--no-wallpaper`
opens an ordinary window. Missing Lively is installed through winget; source
builds need .NET 8 SDK for the helper's first build. See the
[Windows lifecycle and experiments](docs/windows_wallpaper_lifecycle.md).

Wallpaper Engine remains compatible. Set `AMADEUS_WALLPAPER_HOST=external` for
the original manual workflow: start Amadeus, add the URL below to Lively
(WebView2 recommended), then click **Wallpaper** in the Amadeus sidebar:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:17777/wallpaper/lively/index.html
```

This stable entry discovers the actual asset and bridge ports automatically
and waits in place while wallpaper mode is off. Do not hard-code `17778` or
`17797`. For diagnostics, run
`uv run --locked --no-sync python tools\run_wallpaper_engine_bridge.py` and use the printed `Lively URL`.
See the [Lively entry guide](wallpaper/lively/README.md).

macOS has no corresponding Lively/Wallpaper Engine desktop host. When
**Wallpaper** is activated, Electron hosts the full scene at the desktop level
and uses a separate transparent window for the interactive Canvas. The scene
remains click-through so it does not block Finder desktop icons. The macOS
Electron wallpaper host has community real-device verification; dependency
and CI work is tracked by
[#46](https://github.com/Code-Amadeus/Amadeus/pull/46), and signing,
notarization, and an installer are not included yet.

### Graphics performance

All PixiJS character and wallpaper surfaces share one graphics profile. Configure
it in **Settings → Graphics & performance**, or through `.env`:

[GUI preview](docs/images/graphics-performance-settings.png) (custom settings awaiting restart).

| `GRAPHICS_PROFILE` | Maximum frame rate | Resolution | Purpose |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `standard` (default) | 60 FPS | Native device-pixel ratio | Preserve animation quality |
| `power_saving` | 30 FPS | Up to 1.5× | Reduce GPU use, power consumption, and heat |
| `custom` | `RENDER_MAX_FPS` | `RENDER_MAX_RESOLUTION` | Set a custom performance budget |

Custom frame rates support 10–240 FPS and resolution supports 0.25–4.0. Example:

```dotenv
GRAPHICS_PROFILE=custom
RENDER_MAX_FPS=45
RENDER_MAX_RESOLUTION=1.25
```

When Wallpaper Engine supplies a user FPS setting through
[`applyGeneralProperties().fps`](https://docs.wallpaperengine.io/en/web/performance/fps.html),
the runtime uses the lower of that setting and the project profile. Electron,
Lively, and other character surfaces use the project profile directly.
The GUI exposes custom FPS and pixel-density limits when **Custom** is selected,
preserving those values when switching presets. Saved desktop settings apply on
backend restart; reopen existing character and wallpaper windows afterward.
The page shows current backend limits separately from saved choices. Wallpaper
Engine may impose a lower FPS cap; displayed limits are not measured frame rates.

#### Experimental texture sampling (off by default)

`RENDER_TEXTURE_SAMPLING=false` preserves the existing full-frame loading and
playback rules. On **16GB systems or other memory-constrained setups**, consider
trying **Experimental texture sampling** in the graphics page with the 30 FPS
power-saving profile. The toggle is independent of presets and remains off by
default. The equivalent `.env` values are:

```dotenv
GRAPHICS_PROFILE=power_saving
RENDER_TEXTURE_SAMPLING=true
```

When enabled, character frames are sampled against the effective FPS budget,
preserving required hold frames, animation duration and mouth-anchor indices.
One local 30 FPS offscreen experiment reduced CPU texture buffers by about 50%
with similar frame pacing. This is not a claim of halving total RAM or VRAM;
16GB hardware and long-running sessions still need validation.
See the [experiment and limitations](docs/fps_texture_sampling_experiment_2026-09-16.md).

Restart Amadeus/the backend and reopen the wallpaper after changing this option.
Changing the draw FPS alone does not rebuild the texture cache. To restore the
existing behavior, set `RENDER_TEXTURE_SAMPLING=false` and restart in the same way.

## Configuration ownership

Startup values use one precedence order:

1. Parent-process environment variables (highest authority; shown as locked in the GUI)
2. Electron desktop settings
3. Repository-root `.env`
4. Defaults in `config/settings.py`

Settings never rewrites `.env`. Ordinary models, voice, microphones,
Providers/MCP, vision, avatars, and character-pack status belong in the GUI;
advanced diagnostics, experimental thresholds, and test-only flags remain in
`.env`. Secrets use the operating system's `safeStorage` encryption. See
[configuration ownership](config/README.md) and
[local instance authentication](docs/local_instance_authentication.md).
